* Koch snowflakes

** Quadratic type 1
Alphabet: F
Constants: + -
Start: F
Rules: F -> F+F-F-F+F

** Quadratic type 2
Alphabet: F
Constants: + -
Start: F
Rules: F -> F+F-F-FF+F+F-F

* Encoding data in IFS curves
This feels very inefficient, but I had the idea and implementation seems simple enough.
